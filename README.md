## Project Overview

### Abstract

This project presents the **development and implementation of an autonomous vehicle** designed for the **World Robot Olympiad (WRO) 2025 â€“ Future Engineers** category.  
The competition challenges participants to design, construct, and program a self-driving car capable of completing specific tasks under varying environmental and rule-based conditions.

The **Future Engineers** category includes two types of challenges that must be solved using the same autonomous system:

- **Open Challenge:**  
  The vehicle must autonomously complete three laps on a predefined track. The **starting position** and **driving direction** (clockwise or counterclockwise) are **randomly assigned** before each run.

- **Obstacle Challenge:**  
  Similar to the Open Challenge, the vehicle must complete three laps while **detecting and responding to colored pillars** that simulate traffic signals:  
  - **Red pillars â†’ Turn right**  
  - **Green pillars â†’ Turn left**

In addition to performance, **technical documentation** is a critical evaluation component. Teams are required to maintain a **public repository** showcasing their engineering process, including code, CAD designs, and validation results.

## Mobility Management

### Chassis

The chassis was built using LEGO components, chosen for their accessibility, modularity, and precision.  
Initial design work was conducted in **Studio 2.0**, allowing for part optimization and dimension validation.  
After evaluating several steering configurations, a compact and lightweight design was selected to balance performance and stability.

### Steering System

The steering mechanism is powered by a **LEGO EV3 Medium Motor**.  
A gear system translates rotational movement into steering action with a **maximum steering angle of 45Â°**.  
A linkage bar ensures synchronous wheel movement for accurate directional control.

### Movement and Traction System

The drive system utilizes **two EV3 Medium Motors** connected through a **differential gear**.  
Initially, a single motor configuration was tested but lacked the required torque; thus, a second motor was integrated for enhanced performance and stability.

Each motor delivers:
- **Position accuracy:** Â±1Â°  
- **Torque:** 0.08 Nm  
- **Speed:** 240 RPM (no-load)

The transmission uses a **20-tooth to 12-tooth** gear ratio for speed amplification, followed by a **28-tooth to 20-tooth** differential system driving both rear wheels.

### Differential

The **differential** distributes torque between the left and right wheels, enabling smooth turning behavior:
- **Straight motion:** both wheels rotate equally.  
- **Turning:** the outer wheel spins faster for smooth cornering.

## Power and Sense Management

  <sub><em>Image 5.1: Power and sense diagram</em></sub>
</div>

### Power Management

The systemâ€™s core is the **LEGO EV3 Brick**, powered by a **10V, 2050 mAh lithium battery**.  
It provides energy to all motors and sensors through dedicated ports.  

**Power consumption:**
- Movement motors: 150â€“250 mA each  
- Steering motor: 120â€“250 mA

### Sense Management

Two **OpenMV H7 cameras** enable real-time environmental awareness:
- **Camera 1:** wall avoidance  
- **Camera 2:** color detection, line counting, and parking recognition  

Each camera communicates with the EV3 through a custom **EasyEDA-designed PCB** via UART (RX/TX).

## Obstacle Management

The vision system uses **LAB color calibration** and defines **four ROIs** for multi-level perception:
- Low ROI â€“ line tracking  
- Middle ROI â€“ color and obstacle detection  
- High ROI â€“ long-distance anticipation  
- Black ROI â€“ collision alerts  

Color detection governs the reaction:
- **Red â†’ Right turn**  
- **Green â†’ Left turn**

  <sub><em>Image 6.1: Color detection example</em></sub>
</div>

---

## Calibration

To ensure stable color detection under different lighting conditions, **auto-gain**, **auto-white balance**, and **exposure** were disabled and manually adjusted.  
Each LAB threshold (for white, red, green, blue, orange) was fine-tuned through iterative testing.

## ROI Evolution

| Stage | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Initial | Single ROI for basic line tracking. |
| Intermediate | Trapezoidal multi-zone configuration. |
| September | Three dynamic horizontal ROIs. |
| Current | Four adaptive ROIs (Low, Middle, High, Black) providing full-scene coverage. |

---

## Detection and Avoidance Strategies

| Issue | Solution |
|--------|-----------|
| Light variation caused unstable readings | Fixed exposure, gain, and white balance |
| Distant pillars lost in turns | Dynamic ROIs with base-X compensation |
| Oversized blobs caused misclassification | Blob base X used for stability |
| Multiple OpenMV scripts | Unified via LPF2 protocol |
| Poor line following in variable-width corridors | Proportional control based on corridor width |
| Missed black zones | Dedicated Black ROI for collision detection |
