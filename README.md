Mobility management

We built our vehicle using LEGO pieces, chosen for their accessibility and for allowing a compact and efficient design, which ensures good performance on the track. Initially, we designed the prototype using Studio 2.0 software to identify the most suitable LEGO parts for the chassis. Then, we evaluated different steering system methods and adapted them to our custom chassis, paying close attention to the required measurements and proportions.

For the steering system, we opted for the medium motor from the EV3 Core Set. The gear mechanism converts and transmits the motor’s rotation into steering movement. Additionally, the wheels are connected through a linkage bar that ensures both rotate simultaneously and in a coordinated manner.

We also designed the movement and traction system that will drive our vehicle. Initially, we considered using a single LEGO medium motor with a differential system to power both wheels; however, this motor did not provide enough power. To achieve more efficient movement, a second medium motor was added to the differential system, along with a transmission that converts the motor’s energy into mechanical energy for the wheels.

Using medium motors provides fast and precise movements, with a position accuracy of ±1°, a torque of 0.08 Nm, and a no-load speed of 240 RPM.

The transmission consists of 20-tooth gears directly connected to 12-tooth gears. This setup increases the rotational speed delivered to the differential, which then transmits the motion through shafts to a 28-tooth gear, subsequently connected to a 20-tooth gear that drives the wheels on both sides of the vehicle.

What is a differential?

It is a mechanical component located on the drive axle of a vehicle.

Operating principle:
The differential is responsible for distributing engine torque to the wheels.

Power input: The motor transmits torque to the pinion and crown (bevel gear) of the differential.

Torque distribution: Inside the differential, planetary or satellite gears allow:


When the vehicle moves straight: both wheels rotate at the same speed.

When the vehicle turns: the outer wheel rotates faster than the inner wheel.

Power output: Each axle connected to the wheels receives the appropriate torque.
