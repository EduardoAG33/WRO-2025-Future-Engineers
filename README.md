## Project Overview

### Abstract

We present the **development and implementation of an autonomous vehicle** designed for the **World Robot Olympiad 2025 ‚Äì Future Engineers** category.  
The competition challenges participants to design, construct, and program a self-driving car capable of completing specific tasks under variable environmental and rule-based conditions.

The **Future Engineers** category consists of **two main challenges**:

1. **Open Challenge**  
   - The vehicle must autonomously complete **three laps** on a predefined track.  
   - The **starting position** and **driving direction** (clockwise or counterclockwise) are **randomly assigned** before each run.

2. **Obstacle Challenge**  
   - Similar to the Open Challenge, but the vehicle must **detect and react to colored pillars** acting as traffic signals:  
     - **Red pillars ‚Üí Turn right**  
     - **Green pillars ‚Üí Turn left**

**Documentation:**  
Documentation is a critical component of the challenge, as it reflects the team‚Äôs **engineering process**. Teams are required to maintain a **public repository** including code, CAD files, logs, and other technical documentation.

## Mobility Management

### Chassis
The main chassis consists of LEGO pieces selected for their accessibility and for enabling a compact and efficient design. Initially, the prototype was designed using Studio 2.0 software to ensure proper part selection and structural balance.  
For the second level, an acrylic base (acrylate polymer) was used to support the ultrasonic sensors. The shape of this base was customized as part of the design by applying heat to specific areas to mold it into the desired form.  
This level integrates five ultrasonic sensors, strategically distributed to enhance environmental detection and obstacle avoidance.  
This design was made in OnShape:

<div align="center">
<img width="1000" height="1000" alt="Ultrasonic and PCB Base" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48febdb7-b3fb-46fc-b429-0648d3b4971d" />
</div>

The elaboration process:

Using a heat gun, each side of the acrylic base designated for the sensors was carefully heated. Once the material reached the appropriate temperature, it was bent using a mold to achieve the 90¬∞ angle required for the optimal positioning and field of view of the sensors.

<div align="center">

</div>

The final result is mounted on the robot:

</div>

This base is attached to the chassis using four screws in the middle to give it stability, and on top of this locate the PCB is located where the ultrasonic sensors are connected.

The measurements for the sensor support can be found in the datasheet.

**base 3**

On the PCB board, we mounted an additional acrylic base to secure the camera, and to place a voltmeter and a switch for the 18650 batteries. The gyroscope sensor is located in the central part of the assembly for optimal orientation measurement.

</div>

And for the upper level of the robot, we have the support for the camera and the Neo pixel light:  

<div align="center">
<img width="500" height="500" alt="camera support" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e680e149-5586-4c7b-b0e2-6f53eb4f0bf5" />
</div>

The support is positioned at a 70¬∞ inclination to ensure the vehicle remains within the maximum allowed height. This angle was carefully chosen to optimize the camera‚Äôs field of view, as detailed in the Power and Sense Management section.

**Changes and improvements**

Initially, the robot used two cameras. The first camera detected walls, while the second read floor lines for lap counting and identified pillar colors in the Obstacle Challenge. This setup aimed to avoid extra sensors due to the cameras‚Äô high precision.

However, issues arose with ambient light sensitivity, calibration time, and battery consumption. To improve reliability, the second camera was replaced with five ultrasonic sensors positioned at frontal, 90¬∞, and 45¬∞ angles to measure distances to walls.

The sensors communicate with the EV3 via two Arduino Nanos: one collects the data, and the other sends it via I2C. The system is mounted on a custom PCB.

This custom piece is designed to fit perfectly with LEGO components, allowing it to be mounted on the chassis and securely hold the sensor according to the dimensions specified in its datasheet.

The custom piece and sensor are precisely positioned to ensure optimal alignment and secure integration with the LEGO chassis, based on the sensor‚Äôs datasheet dimensions.

</div>

## Problems and solutions
**Change of the sensor** 

we decided to change the previous sensor (VL53L0X) since when doing tests we had performance failures based on the walls since the distances varied a lot because the sensor laser is affected by the black color of the walls. We determined this by changing to a white color and seeing that the distances no longer varied with this, at the time of having the error this causing it to collide with the stops.
Solution:
The change was implemented for an ultrasonic DF robot URM09, it is working better, the objective changed it was no longer necessary to use it for parking, but as an aid to the turn sensor at the end of the laps of the open challenge round in case the vehicle finished outside the section, this ultrasonic would mark the distance (or the one in front depending on the height at which the robot finishes) to join the final arrival area.
To place the sensor, it only fits on the base of the previous one.

In the Mexican National Tournament, we only used one differential, and the robot dimensions were both wider and taller. For the updated version, we decided to implement two differentials, as this configuration provides significantly better control when moving forward. Additionally, reducing the robot‚Äôs overall dimensions helps prevent collisions with obstacles and makes it easier to maneuver around them.

---

### Steering System
The EV3‚Äôs middle motor converts rotational motion into steering movement through a gear train mechanism. The wheels are linked by a connecting rod, allowing them to move freely. With the assistance of the front differential, this setup transmits motion through the drivetrain to the rear motors, enabling smooth and controlled movement.

The steering rotation is limited to 45 degrees due to the chassis design; however, this range is sufficient for proper turning and obstacle avoidance. If needed, the rotation angle can be further reduced through the block programming.  
**Functionality:**

- **Pinion (engranaje circular):** The circular gear located at the center of the structure. When it rotates, it moves the rack from side to side.  
- **Rack (toothed bar):** A long bar with teeth that meshes with the pinion. When the pinion turns, the rack slides horizontally.  
- **Wheel connection:** The ends of the rack are linked to the wheels through steering arms. When the rack moves, it pushes or pulls these arms, causing the wheels to turn.

### Movement and Traction System
Two medium motors with differential system transmit energy to wheels. Transmission: 20-tooth ‚Üí 12-tooth gears ‚Üí 28-tooth ‚Üí 20-tooth driving wheels. Position accuracy ¬±1¬∞, torque 0.08 Nm, speed 240 RPM.  
According to the competition rules, the engines cannot be mounted directly on the wheels. Therefore, we chose to implement a transmission system connected to the differential, allowing the engine‚Äôs motion to be transferred to the tires, causing them to rotate.  
We decided to use two motors because they offer greater speed, power, and stability to the vehicle‚Äôs base compared to using only one. This configuration allows for a more balanced distribution of torque, improving traction and control during movement. After testing different options, we chose the medium LEGO motor because it provides an optimal balance between size, weight, and energy efficiency, making it ideal for our chassis design. Additionally, its compact structure facilitates integration into the transmission system while maintaining low power consumption and reliable performance.

### About Differential
Distributes torque to wheels, enabling smooth cornering. Input via pinion and crown gears. Outer wheel rotates faster in turns, inner wheel slower, straight motion equal.

A differential is a mechanical component that allows wheels on the same axle to rotate at different speeds while transmitting power from the motor. This is especially important when a vehicle turns, as the outer wheel needs to travel a greater distance than the inner wheel. The differential distributes torque between the wheels, ensuring smooth and efficient movement, reducing tire wear, and improving traction and stability. In our design, the differential receives motion from the transmission and transfers it to the tires, enabling precise control of the vehicle‚Äôs movement.

## Impact of vehicle dimensions

The robot‚Äôs compact dimensions ‚Äî 15 cm wide, 29 cm long, and 26 cm high ‚Äî allow for the precise integration of both the steering and traction systems, enabling accurate and stable turns.
It was designed to be as narrow as possible, minimizing the risk of collisions with walls during sharp turns.

In the Open Challenge, our robot uses five ultrasonic sensors together with an OpenMV camera, creating an intelligent system that allows it to detect obstacles and move safely.
The front ultrasonic sensor detects when a curve begins. The camera and ultrasonic sensors work together through a PID control system, and we also correct measurement errors from the ultrasonic sensors using gain adjustments depending on their inclination.
This helps the robot identify whether a corridor is open or closed, effectively avoiding collisions with walls and improving navigation accuracy.

For the Obstacle Challenge, we took advantage of the robot‚Äôs width, length, and height to optimize its performance in different scenarios.
The width, being narrow, allows the vehicle to pass easily between pillars without collisions.
The length was optimized for the parking task ‚Äî we extended the vehicle and added a rear spoiler to make the most of the rule that define the parking area as 1.5 times the vehicle‚Äôs length. This provides more freedom and precision when parking.
The height was designed to ensure better visibility of obstacles, allowing the sensors and camera to detect objects from their base to their top. This also prevents the robot from re-detecting the same obstacle after an evasive maneuver or a sharp turn, ensuring smoother navigation and preventing unnecessary repeated avoidance actions.

The OpenMV H7 Pro is a low-power machine vision camera designed for embedded systems. It operates at 5V, drawing a typical current of 250‚Äì300 mA during normal operation, and up to 480 mA when all peripherals are active.
Key considerations for energy management:

**IR LEDs:** High current draw when enabled; use sparingly to extend battery life.

**MicroSD Logging:** Writing images or logs increases power usage slightly.

**Processing Load:** More complex algorithms (e.g., object recognition, color tracking) increase CPU activity and power draw.

**GPIO Outputs:** PWM and other peripherals also consume extra current.
  
Powered at 3.3V, max 480 mA, connected via custom PCB to EV3.

The camera is mounted at a 70¬∞ angle on the highest point of the vehicle. This position was selected to maximize the field of view, allowing the vehicle to better detect obstacles and monitor the track, covering a larger area and facilitating the identification of the designated parking zone. Initially, the camera was positioned at the front of the vehicle, above the steering system. However, it faced visibility issues, as the field of view was limited, which led to errors when avoiding the pillars.

### Description

The **DFRobot Gravity BNO055** is an intelligent 9-axis absolute orientation sensor that combines an accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer with an onboard 32-bit microcontroller running Bosch sensor fusion algorithms.  
This integration allows the module to directly output orientation data (Euler angles or quaternions) without requiring complex calculations from the main microcontroller.

In our robot, this sensor is used to determine the **precise orientation and tilt** of the vehicle, improving stability and movement control during navigation tasks.

We use this sensor to count laps on the track, processing the data with the Arduino to send the information to the Ev3 and then with a programming block we decide the count of the laps based on its initial position where it will also end in the same place

**PCB**
During the PCB design process, we engraved the circuit using a laser machine. Afterward, we applied ferric chloride to etch away the excess copper, leaving only the designed traces. The board was then drilled, cleaned, and prepared for soldering and component assembly.

The PCBs designed for the ultrasonic sensors and camera are fully fabricated, cleaned, and ready for component mounting and final assembly.

This PCB is powered by two 18650 lithium batteries connected in series, providing a total supply voltage of approximately 8V. A voltage regulator steps down the voltage to 5V to reliably power the ultrasonic sensors and the NeoPixel LED module.

The system architecture includes two Arduino microcontrollers:

Arduino 1 handles the acquisition and processing of data from the ultrasonic sensors.

Arduino 2 manages data communication and transmits processed information to the LEGO EV3 brick via the I2C communication protocol.

This configuration enables seamless integration with the EV3 environment, allowing real-time data exchange and programming through EV3 graphical blocks.

## Arduino Slave with NeoPixel & HC-SR04 Sensors ‚Äì I2C Communication

This code runs on an Arduino acting as an **I2C slave** that collects sensor data, maps it, and sends it to a master device. It also controls a NeoPixel matrix for lighting feedback.



### Libraries
- **`Wire.h`**: Handles I2C communication as a slave device.  
- **`SoftwareSerial.h`**: Creates a secondary serial port to read CSV data from another Nano.  
- **`Adafruit_NeoPixel.h`**: Controls a 16-LED NeoPixel matrix.  
- **`NewPing.h`**: Manages ultrasonic HC-SR04 sensors efficiently.



### Sensors
- Front ultrasonic sensor (`frontU`) reads distance in cm.  
- Rear analog sensors connected to `A6` and `A7` are scaled to 0‚Äì500 units.  
- Additional distance sensors (`l45`, `r45`, `l90`, `r90`) and lap counter are read via a secondary Nano through SoftwareSerial.  


### Data Mapping
- Distance readings are mapped to **-100‚Ä¶100**.  
- Analog readings are mapped to **-127‚Ä¶127**.  
- `frontbyte`, `l45byte`, `r45byte`, `l90byte`, `r90byte`, `A6byte`, `A7byte` store the mapped values.



### NeoPixel Control
- Initializes a 16-LED matrix on pin 9.  
- Brightness is mapped using `POT_LUZ` from 0‚Äì100 to 0‚Äì255.  
- Shows initial static color on setup.



### I2C Communication
- Arduino acts as **slave with address 0x04**.  
- `sendData()` sends a requested byte depending on `mind_n_DATO_1`.  
- `onreceiveEvent()` reads commands from the master device.  
- Case 6 uses a **flag (`linkSent`)** to send a single pulse only once.  


### CSV Processing
- Receives lines from the secondary Nano via `SoftwareSerial`.  
- Each CSV line contains 5 values: `l90, l45, r45, r90, laps`.  
- `processLine()` parses the string and updates sensor variables.


### Loop Behavior
1. Reads front ultrasonic sensor and analog values.  
2. Reads CSV from the secondary Nano and parses it.  
3. Maps all sensor values to the specified ranges.  
4. Updates internal state for I2C requests.  

---

This setup allows **real-time sensor fusion**, mapping, and I2C data delivery to a master controller while providing visual feedback through the NeoPixel matrix.
