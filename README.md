## Project Overview

### Abstract

We present the **development and implementation of an autonomous vehicle** designed for the **World Robot Olympiad 2025 ‚Äì Future Engineers** category.  
The competition challenges participants to design, construct, and program a self-driving car capable of completing specific tasks under variable environmental and rule-based conditions.

The **Future Engineers** category consists of **two main challenges**:

1. **Open Challenge**  
   - The vehicle must autonomously complete **three laps** on a predefined track.  
   - The **starting position** and **driving direction** (clockwise or counterclockwise) are **randomly assigned** before each run.

2. **Obstacle Challenge**  
   - Similar to the Open Challenge, but the vehicle must **detect and react to colored pillars** acting as traffic signals:  
     - **Red pillars ‚Üí Turn right**  
     - **Green pillars ‚Üí Turn left**

**Documentation:**  
Documentation is a critical component of the challenge, as it reflects the team‚Äôs **engineering process**. Teams are required to maintain a **public repository** including code, CAD files, logs, and other technical documentation.

## Mobility Management

### Chassis
The main chassis consists of LEGO pieces selected for their accessibility and for enabling a compact and efficient design. Initially, the prototype was designed using Studio 2.0 software to ensure proper part selection and structural balance.  
For the second level, an acrylic base (acrylate polymer) was used to support the ultrasonic sensors. The shape of this base was customized as part of the design by applying heat to specific areas to mold it into the desired form.  
This level integrates five ultrasonic sensors, strategically distributed to enhance environmental detection and obstacle avoidance.

<div align="center">
<img width="800" height="800" alt="Ultrasonic and PCB Base" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48febdb7-b3fb-46fc-b429-0648d3b4971d" />
</div>

The elaboration process:

Using a heat gun, each side of the acrylic base designated for the sensors was carefully heated. Once the material reached the appropriate temperature, it was bent using a mold to achieve the 90¬∞ angle required for the optimal positioning and field of view of the sensors.

<div align="center">

</div>

This base is attached to the chassis using four screws in the middle to give it stability, and on top of this locate the PCB is located where the ultrasonic sensors are connected.

The measurements for the sensor support can be found in the datasheet.

The support is positioned at a 70¬∞ inclination to ensure the vehicle remains within the maximum allowed height. This angle was carefully chosen to optimize the camera‚Äôs field of view, as detailed in the Power and Sense Management section.

In the Mexican National Tournament, we only used one differential, and the robot dimensions were both wider and taller. For the updated version, we decided to implement two differentials, as this configuration provides significantly better control when moving forward. Additionally, reducing the robot‚Äôs overall dimensions helps prevent collisions with obstacles and makes it easier to maneuver around them.



### Steering System
The EV3‚Äôs middle motor converts rotational motion into steering movement through a gear train mechanism. The wheels are linked by a connecting rod, allowing them to move freely. With the assistance of the front differential, this setup transmits motion through the drivetrain to the rear motors, enabling smooth and controlled movement.

The steering rotation is limited to 45 degrees due to the chassis design; however, this range is sufficient for proper turning and obstacle avoidance. If needed, the rotation angle can be further reduced through the block programming.
Functionality

Pinion (circular gear): The circular gear located at the center of the structure. When it rotates, it moves the rack from side to side.

Rack (toothed bar): A long bar with teeth that meshes with the pinion. As the pinion turns, the rack slides horizontally.

Wheel connection: The ends of the rack are linked to the wheels through steering arms. When the rack moves, it pushes or pulls these arms, causing the wheels to turn.

### Movement and Traction System
Two medium motors with differential system transmit energy to wheels. Transmission: 20-tooth ‚Üí 12-tooth gears ‚Üí 28-tooth ‚Üí 20-tooth driving wheels. Position accuracy ¬±1¬∞, torque 0.08 Nm, speed 240 RPM.
According to the competition rules, the engines cannot be mounted directly on the wheels. Therefore, we chose to implement a transmission system connected to the differential, allowing the engine‚Äôs motion to be transferred to the tires, causing them to rotate.
We decided to use two motors because they offer greater speed, power, and stability to the vehicle‚Äôs base compared to using only one. This configuration allows for a more balanced distribution of torque, improving traction and control during movement. After testing different options, we chose the medium LEGO motor because it provides an optimal balance between size, weight, and energy efficiency, making it ideal for our chassis design. Additionally, its compact structure facilitates integration into the transmission system while maintaining low power consumption and reliable performance.

## Power and Sense Management
The Power and Sensor Management system of the vehicle is engineered to optimize energy distribution and ensure reliable operation of all electronic components. It carefully regulates the power supply to motors and sensors, maintaining stability and efficiency under varying load conditions. This system enables precise control over sensor readings and motor performance, supporting accurate navigation, obstacle detection, and overall vehicle functionality.

The OpenMV H7 Pro is a low-power machine vision camera designed for embedded systems. It operates at 5V, drawing a typical current of 250‚Äì300 mA during normal operation, and up to 480 mA when all peripherals are active.
Key considerations for energy management:

**IR LEDs:** High current draw when enabled; use sparingly to extend battery life.

**MicroSD Logging:** Writing images or logs increases power usage slightly.

**Processing Load:** More complex algorithms (e.g., object recognition, color tracking) increase CPU activity and power draw.

**GPIO Outputs:** PWM and other peripherals also consume extra current.
  
Powered at 3.3V, max 480 mA, connected via custom PCB to EV3.

The camera is mounted at a 70¬∞ angle on the highest point of the vehicle. This position was selected to maximize the field of view, allowing the vehicle to better detect obstacles and monitor the track, covering a larger area and facilitating the identification of the designated parking zone. Initially, the camera was positioned at the front of the vehicle, above the steering system. However, it faced visibility issues, as the field of view was limited, which led to errors when avoiding the pillars.

The 4x4 RGB LED matrix contains 16 individually addressable LEDs. Each LED operates at 5V DC and can draw approximately 60 mA at full brightness when displaying white (all three colors at maximum).

Typical current per LED: 60 mA (max)

Total current for 16 LEDs at full brightness: 16 √ó 60 mA = 960 mA

**P = V √ó I = 5V √ó 0.96A ‚âà 4.8 Watts**

We use Neopixel LED to support the camera, as they help improve the distinction of colors in obstacles and the parking lot. The Neopixels are controlled using the NeoPixel library in Arduino, which then sends data to the EV3. This setup allows the EV3 to adjust the intensity of the Neopixels dynamically, enhancing the robot‚Äôs color detection and visual accuracy.

A 4x4 WS2812B matrix usually has 3 main pins:

VCC (Power)

Supplies 5V DC to the LEDs.

Connect to the 5V pin on Arduino or an external 5V power source.

GND (Ground)

Common ground for power and data.

Connect to Arduino GND and the negative terminal of the power supply.

DIN (Data In)

Receives the digital control signal from the Arduino.

Connect to a digital pin on Arduino (e.g., D6).

DOUT (Data Out) ‚Äì optional for chaining

Allows connection to the Data In of another matrix for cascading multiple matrices.
