## Mobility Management

### Chassis

We built our vehicle using LEGO pieces, chosen for their accessibility and for allowing a compact and efficient design, which ensures good performance on the track. Initially, we designed the prototype using Studio 2.0 software to identify the most suitable LEGO parts for the chassis. Then, we evaluated different steering system methods and adapted them to our custom chassis, paying close attention to the required measurements and proportions.

### Steering System

For the steering system, we opted for the medium motor from the EV3 Core Set. The gear mechanism converts and transmits the motor’s rotation into steering movement, with a maximum steering angle of 45°. On the steering motor, a 12-tooth double bevel gear transmits motion to a 12-tooth single gear, which, through a proportional shaft, transfers the movement generated by the motor to the wheels. Additionally, the wheels are connected through a linkage bar that ensures both rotate simultaneously and in a coordinated manner, providing precise control during turns and track navigation.

### Movement and Traction System

We also designed the movement and traction system that will drive our vehicle. Initially, we considered using a single LEGO medium motor with a differential system to power both wheels; however, this motor did not provide enough power. To achieve more efficient movement, a second medium motor was added to the differential system, along with a transmission that converts the motor’s energy into mechanical energy for the wheels.

Using medium motors provides fast and precise movements, with a position accuracy of ±1°, a torque of 0.08 Nm, and a no-load speed of 240 RPM.

The transmission consists of 20-tooth gears directly connected to 12-tooth gears. This setup increases the rotational speed delivered to the differential, which then transmits the motion through shafts to a 28-tooth gear, subsequently connected to a 20-tooth gear that drives the wheels on both sides of the vehicle.

### Differential

**What is a differential?**

It is a mechanical component located on the drive axle of a vehicle.

**Operating principle:**
The differential is responsible for distributing engine torque to the wheels.

* **Power input:** The motor transmits torque to the pinion and crown (bevel gear) of the differential.
* **Torque distribution:** Inside the differential, planetary or satellite gears allow:

  * When the vehicle moves straight: both wheels rotate at the same speed.
  * When the vehicle turns: the outer wheel rotates faster than the inner wheel.
* **Power output:** Each axle connected to the wheels receives the appropriate torque.

## Power and Sense Management

### Power Management

Our main controller is the EV3 Brick from LEGO Mindstorms. This device receives information from the sensors and is responsible for controlling the motors. The controller features 4 motor ports (A, B, C, D) and 4 sensor ports (1, 2, 3, 4).

It is powered by a rechargeable lithium battery with an output of 10 V and 2050 mAh capacity. We consulted the hardware manual to understand the power consumption specifications of both motors and sensors, in order to optimize battery performance and select the most suitable sensors for our car.

Our robot uses three EV3 Medium Motors:

* **Two motors for movement:** Each connected to a transmission system and a differential, providing efficient power distribution to the wheels. These motors typically consume **150–250 mA** under normal operation, with peaks of **500–800 mA** under heavy load or during startup.
* **One motor for steering:** This motor generally operates under a lighter load, consuming **120–250 mA**, with brief peaks around **400–500 mA**.

### Sense Management

For the sensor system, we used two OpenMV H7 cameras: one is responsible for avoiding collisions with walls, while the other detects traffic lights, counts lines, and locates the parking area. We also calculated the cameras’ positions on the vehicle to ensure correct vision using wide-angle lenses. We selected these cameras due to their low power consumption, which does not affect the EV3, and their compact size, making them easy to integrate into the chassis. Each camera draws up to 480 mA at 3.3 V. To connect them to the EV3, we designed a PCB in EasyEDA that enables communication through the RX, TX, Vin, and GND ports. The cameras also include their own IDE for programming in Python.
