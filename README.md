**Role:** Programming & Mechanics  

I started participating in robotics tournaments from 2016 to 2019, achieving **two second places** in the Mexican Robotics Tournament (TMR). Due to the **Covid-19 pandemic**, I couldn‚Äôt compete again until 2024, when I returned as a **coach** in TMR and WRO, earning a spot at the international competition. I am currently in my final year of **Mechatronics Engineering**.

## Project Overview

### Abstract

We present the **development and implementation of an autonomous vehicle** designed for the **World Robot Olympiad 2025 ‚Äì Future Engineers** category.  
The competition challenges participants to design, construct, and program a self-driving car capable of completing specific tasks under variable environmental and rule-based conditions.

The **Future Engineers** category consists of **two main challenges**:

1. **Open Challenge**  
   - The vehicle must autonomously complete **three laps** on a predefined track.  
   - The **starting position** and **driving direction** (clockwise or counterclockwise) are **randomly assigned** before each run.

2. **Obstacle Challenge**  
   - Similar to the Open Challenge, but the vehicle must **detect and react to colored pillars** acting as traffic signals:  
     - **Red pillars ‚Üí Turn right**  
     - **Green pillars ‚Üí Turn left**

**Documentation:**  
Documentation is a critical component of the challenge, as it reflects the team‚Äôs **engineering process**. Teams are required to maintain a **public repository** including code, CAD files, logs, and other technical documentation.

## Mobility Management

### Chassis
The main chassis consists of LEGO pieces selected for their accessibility and for enabling a compact and efficient design. Initially, the prototype was designed using Studio 2.0 software to ensure proper part selection and structural balance.  
For the second level, an acrylic base (acrylate polymer) was used to support the ultrasonic sensors. The shape of this base was customized as part of the design by applying heat to specific areas to mold it into the desired form.  
This level integrates five ultrasonic sensors, strategically distributed to enhance environmental detection and obstacle avoidance.

<div align="center">
<img width="800" height="800" alt="Ultrasonic and PCB Base" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48febdb7-b3fb-46fc-b429-0648d3b4971d" />
</div>

The elaboration process:

Using a heat gun, each side of the acrylic base designated for the sensors was carefully heated. Once the material reached the appropriate temperature, it was bent using a mold to achieve the 90¬∞ angle required for the optimal positioning and field of view of the sensors.

<div align="center">
  <img width="400" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53dec651-0a3b-47fa-895d-e4c19290b290" />

</div>

## The final result is mounted on the robot

</div>

This base is attached to the chassis using four screws in the middle to give it stability, and on top of this locate the PCB is located where the ultrasonic sensors are connected.

The measurements for the sensor support can be found in the datasheet.

https://github.com/EduardoAG33/WRO-2025-Future-Engineers/blob/main/Others/HC-SR04_Datasheet_with_Dimensions%20(1).pdf

And for the upper level of the robot, we have the support for the camera and the Neo pixel light:

this support have a 70 degrees of inclination using a lego

</div>
The support is positioned at a 70¬∞ inclination to ensure the vehicle remains within the maximum allowed height. This angle was carefully chosen to optimize the camera‚Äôs field of view, as detailed in the Power and Sense Management section.

## Detection and Avoidance Strategies

**Metric:** X coordinate at blob base  

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|
| Light variations | Fixed auto-gain, auto-white balance, exposure |
| Lost far pillars in curves | Extended dynamic ROIs, blob base compensation |
| Oversized blobs | X coordinate as main metric |
| Redundant OpenMV scripts | Unified via LPF2 protocol |
| Non-reactive line follower | Corridor width as proportional KP |
| Missed pillars ‚Üí collision risk | Dedicated Black ROI |

### Line Tracking
Dynamic ROIs provide position error ‚Üí proportional KP in EV3.

### Corridor Width Regulation
Proportional correction from lower ROIs.

### Obstacle Avoidance
Red ‚Üí right, Green ‚Üí left based on X coordinate vs target.

### Data Communication (OpenMV ‚Üí EV3)
LPF2 protocol: unified data slots.

| Sensor / Source | Metric | Usage |
|-----------------|--------|-------|
| Low ROI | Line error | Main trajectory |
| Middle ROI | Corridor width, colors | Proportional regulation & obstacle anticipation |
| High ROI | Far obstacle position | Curve support |
| Black ROI | Dark area detection | Collision alert |
| Color blobs | X coordinate | Defines avoidance side |
| EV3 Motors | Speed, distance | Smooth control |
| EV3 Logic | KP | Dynamic correction |

---

## Calibration
Fixed camera parameters (auto-gain, auto-white balance, exposure). LAB thresholds adjusted for white, red, green, blue, orange.

---

## ROI Evolution
| Stage | Description |
|-------|------------|
| Initial | Central dynamic ROI anchored to white floor |
| Improvement | Trapezoidal ROIs for path and pillars |
| September | Three horizontal ROIs (low, middle, high) |
| Current | Four adaptive ROIs (Low, Middle, High, Black) covering full scene |
